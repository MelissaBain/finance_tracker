# finance_tracker

Clone the repo into a destination of your choosing. You will need python 3. Then run "python  FinanceTracker.py" on the command line. The intended use of this application is to manually log your daily expenses, while having complete control over the categories. I came up with this program after learning about the cash envelope system. That system seemed really practical for forcing people to be acutely aware of their spending, but it also seemed cumbersome to have to actually use cash for everything. This program serves as a hybrid to the cash envelope system and a more mindless program like Mint, where transactions are often miscategorized by the automatic budget tracker.
